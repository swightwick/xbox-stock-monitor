## xbox stock monitor

This script is to check the stock for the Xbox Series X from Currys. During 2021 stock was sparse and spread out throughout the year, so this was a way of finding when restocks happened.

## What it does
1. Makes a request to the stock API endpoint
2. Determines stock based on response
3. If in stock, posts message to Discord using webhook

## To run
1. run npm install
2. add your WEBHOOK_URL into an .env file
